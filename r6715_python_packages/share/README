The python code in this folder is used in the soil moisture stress evaluation JULES process evaluation group. 

This is just a temporary solution, and there are no guarantees that this code is kept up-to-date or free of bugs.

Please get in touch before using any of this code, and I can put you in contact with the authors, to discuss it further.

Thanks,

Contents

 * jules.py
 
Makes it easier to use JULES output files with Iris (http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/index.html). In particular, provides a wrapper to iris.load, iris.load_cube and iris.save to deal with land-points-only data.
For more information:

    import jules
    help(jules)

The test suite for jules.py is stored internally in the Met Office.


* convertpoints2grid.py

Can convert some types of land-points-only JULES files to a grid from the command line. Usage is

    python2.7 convertpoints2grid.py --inputfile=myinputfile.nc --outputfile=myoutputfile.nc


* soil_cosby_parameters.py 

Calculates soil parameters for use in JULES. Can imported into python or called from the command line as:

Example 1:
    ./soil_cosby_parameters.py --soil_textural_class='Silty clay loam'

Example 2:
    ./soil_cosby_parameters.py --f_sand=0.10 --f_silt=0.56 --f_clay=0.34

Example 3:
    ./soil_cosby_parameters.py --soil_textural_class='Silty clay loam' --f_organic=0.8 --soc_layer=1

See 
    ./soil_cosby_parameters.py --help 

for more information.


* test_soil_cosby_parameters.py 

Test suite for soil_cosby_parameters.py.


* soil_water_stress_factors.py

Work in progress. Collects together some stress factors from the literature and models. 


* test_soil_water_stress_factors.py 

Work in progress. Test suite for soil_water_stress_factors.py.


* compare_sinclair_and_jules_p0.py

Plots the Sinclair and JULES water stress functions for each soil textural class.


* huntingford2015_equations.py

Python implementation of the equations used in Huntingford 2015 (this is entirely independent of the
analysis code used by the authors of this paper in the paper itself). This has not been reviewed - please 
get in touch if you are able to help with this.


* test_huntingford2015_equations.py

Test suite for huntingford2015_equations.py.


* fluxnet_evaluation.py, test_fluxnet_evaluation.py, make_time_coord.py, list_sites_lba.txt, list_sites_fluxnet2015.txt 

Work in progress. Plotting and analysis routines for the JPEG rose suite.


* soil_hydrology.py

Python implementation of the soil hydrology functions in JULES, for use in helping understand their behaviour.


* test_soil_hydrology.py

Test suite for soil_hydrology.py


* calc_weights.py

Functions for weighting soil variables for converting between schemes with different layer
thicknesses, and other utils for dealing with soil layers.


* test_calc_weights.py
